### Fixed
- **Article Sublevel Display**: Fixed missing Article Sublevel in tree hierarchy
  - Root cause: Excel data contains 'Article Sublevel ' (with trailing space) but code was looking for 'Article Sublevel' (without space)
  - Updated all tree view operations to use correct column name consistently
  - Fixed row ID generation, dropdown population, and data processing methods
- **User ERP Name Updates**: Fixed User ERP Name not updating after dark mode implementation
  - Updated tree selection handler to recognize new alternating row tag names (erp_item_even, erp_item_odd)
  - Maintained compatibility with existing tag structure while supporting new styling
- **Sublevel Dropdown Population**: Fixed Sublevel dropdown not updating on item selection in Reassign Item section
  - Updated set_selected_item method to use correct column name ('Article Sublevel ' with trailing space)
  - Now all three dropdowns (Category, Subcategory, Sublevel) populate correctly when items are selected
- **AI Generation Functionality**: Fixed AI generation not working properly
  - Fixed UI update calls from background threads using self.main_window.root.after()
  - Changed Generate button initial state from "disabled" to "normal"
  - Improved error handling and user feedback for AI operations
- **Item Selection Issues**: Fixed item selection not working with AI generation
  - Root cause: Row ID delimiter collision with ERP names containing underscores and pipes
  - Implemented robust Unicode delimiter (‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ) that's virtually guaranteed to be unique
  - Updated all row ID generation and parsing to use new delimiter
  - Fixed IndentationError in tree_view.py that was preventing application startup
  - Enhanced AI generation to work with both single and multiple item selections
